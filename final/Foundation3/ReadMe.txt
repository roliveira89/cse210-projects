You have been hired by an event planning company. They help organize and market events throughout the world. They need you to write a program to track each of these events and produce the marketing material to distribute on social media. They typically handle a few main types of events:

A. Lectures, which have a speaker and have a limited capacity.
B. Receptions, which require people to RSVP, or register, beforehand.
C. Outdoor gatherings, which do not have a limit on attendees, but need to track the weather forecast.
Regardless of the type, all events need to have an Event Title, Description, Date, Time, and Address.

They would like the ability to generate three different messages:

A. Standard details - Lists the title, description, date, time, and address.
B. Full details - Lists all of the above, plus type of event and information specific to that event type. For lectures, this includes the speaker name and capacity. For receptions this includes an email for RSVP. For outdoor gatherings, this includes a statement of the weather.
C. Short description - Lists the type of event, title, and the date.
